This collection of files comes from 4 disks labeled DECWNIDOWS 1.03
that came to be in a big box of floppies years ago.

At present it isn't know if these are any good, but the crc of the
files in them differ from what's otherwise available.

These were accomanied by a letter from 1988 that said these could be
uploaded to a BBS.
