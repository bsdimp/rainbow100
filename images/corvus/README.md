Images of CORVUS system disks.

The first two appear to be P-SYSTEM format. They read properly but are neither
CP/M nor MS-DOS filesystems. They appear similar in structure to the p-system
disks in the different archives.

The third image is a CP/M disk with source code to talk to the corvus disk and
network.

The manuals these came with are hosted at http://bitsavers.org/pdf/corvus/ and
have "rainbow" in the name.
